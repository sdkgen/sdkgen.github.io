# Defining your schema

To generate client targets and server schema, sdkgen provides an expressive language, in which you declare your interfaces, API calls and error treatment, all of this, with automatic type validation. 
You can also add annotations to generate documentation and REST endpoints to your exposed functions!

## Primitive types

In addition to having `string`, `int`, `float` and `bool` (which are exactly what you expect), it also has: 

* `uint` - an unsigned integer
* `void` - the absence of any value
* `date` - a simple MM/DD/YYYY date type
* `datetime` - full date type, with time included, always converted to UTC
* `bytes` - a byte buffer, commonly used when uploading files
* `money` - an integer for representing money in cents
* `bigint` - a way to represent integers bigger than 2^53
* `email` - an email address valid value
* `hex` - an hexadecimal number
* `base64` -  encoding format for transfering data via text
* `url` - [URL](https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt)
* `xml` - [XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/)
* `json` - [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-pt.html)

Brazilian utility types:

* `cpf` - personal document number
* `cnpj` - company document number

## Compound types

To compose types into more complex ones, sdkgen provides a TypesScript-like syntax:

```
type UserInfo {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  additionalNeeds: string
  socialName: string
  cpf: cpf
  email: string
  phoneNumber: string
}
```

### Spreading compound types

Complex types can also be spread and used by other types: 

```
type User {
    id: uuid
    ...UserInfo
}
```

In this case, *User* is transformed into:

```
type User {
    id: uuid
    firstName: string
    lastName: string
    additionalNeeds: string
    socialName: string
    cpf: cpf
    email: string
    phoneNumber: string
}
```

## Enums

In sdkgen, enums are types that consist in a fixed set of strings, behaving very similarly to the other languages and being defined this way:

```
type State enum {
    Bahia
    RioDeJaneiro
    SaoPaulo
}
```

You can also define enums inline on compound types:

```
type User {
    username: string
    password: string
    type: enum { Teacher Student Director }
}
```

When receiving or sending enum-typed strings, the sdkgen server will validate if the value matches the provided set.

## Lists

To define a list of any type, you can just put `[]` at the of its definition. In this case, foo is a list of strings:

```
type Game {
    winner: string
    players: string[]
}
```

Your compound type can also be a list:

```
type Car {
    brand: string
    model: string
    owners: string[]
}[]
```


## Optional types

To turn your types optional, add `?` after its definition. sdkgen won't complain if an optional type is not present in any context.

```
type BlogPost {
    title: string
    description: string?
    text: string
}
```

Any sdkgen type can be set as optional:

```
type Comment {
    owner: User
    text: string
    reactions: Reaction[]?
}
```

## Functions

To define what your clients will get and put into the server, you should describe the functions, their arguments and return types:

```
fn createUser(info: UserInfo): User
fn updateUser(info: UserInfo): User

fn removeUser(id: string)

fn getUserHistory(id: string, since: date, until: date): History[]
```

## Errors

By default, sdkgen provides the `Fatal` error type, but, you can create your own to make a more specific error throwing to the clients, as you can see:

```
error InvalidArgument
error NotFound
```

## Annotations

### @rest

It is possible to add a @rest annotation to any sdkgen function to have it exposed as a REST endpoint. Arguments can be received as path fragments, as query parameters, as headers and on the body. Parsing and strict type validation is all done for you: 

```
// Simple get call
@rest GET /status
fn getStatus(): string

// Passing argument on body
@rest POST /users [body {user}]
fn createNewUser(user: NewUser): User

// Sending custom headers
@rest GET /posts [header user-agent: {userAgent}] [header accept-language: {lang}] [header x-token: {token}]
fn getPosts(userAgent: string, lang: string, token: base64): User

// Sending arguments on path and querystring.
@rest GET /chats/{chatId}/messages?{since}&{until} [header x-token: {token}]
fn getMessages(token: base64, chatId: uuid, since: datetime?, until: datetime?): Message[]
```
